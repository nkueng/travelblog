## Welcome to my Blog

Here I write about my traveling experiences abroad.

Beginning in the summer of 2018, I've been able to do an international internship in [**Mexico**](./mexico/main). After working for some 10 weeks, I decided to hit the road and travel the country's marvelous south. All the while, I've kept my friends and family updated with weekly newsletters (in _German_) all of which you can find [here](./mexico/main).

In early 2019, I've relocated to [**Vancouver**](./vancouver/main) to continue my studies as an exchange student. And to do many other things apart from studying, of course. Once again, I am trying to convert my experiences into _English_ [texts](./vancouver/main) â€“ while not with the same regularity for sure with the same passion.

The year 2020 brought about another international experience: This time, I moved to [**Copenhagen**](./copenhagen/main), the picturesque capital of Denmark. There, I will do an internship for six months. You can follow my process of setting up and settling in [here](./copenhagen/main).
