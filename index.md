## Welcome to my Blog

You've probably come here to find out more about my traveling experiences abroad.

Beginning in the summer of 2018, I've been able to do an international internship in [**Mexico**](./mexico/main). After working for some 10 weeks, I've decided to hit the road and travel the country's marvelous south. All the while, I've kept my friends and family updated with weekly newsletters (in _German_) all of which you can find [here](./mexico/main).

For the new year of 2019, I've relocated to [**Vancouver**](./vancouver/main) to continue my studies as an exchange student. And to do many other things apart from studying, of course. Once again, I am trying to convert my experiences into _English_ [texts](./vancouver/main) â€“ while not with the same regularity for sure with the same passion.
