A wise man once said
    Happiness = Reality - Expectations
and ever since hearing this, I find it to prove true over and over again. The major reason for the constant smile on my face whilst in Mexico probably wasn't the overwhelmingly beautiful _Reality_ of _Ju√°rez_, but rather the complete absence of any _Expectation_.

Sadly, the opposite is true for _Vancouver_. Here, I've been able to experience some of the best time of my life four years ago. For one, I attended an easy-going language school to improve my English (which has only gotten worse ever since...) and possibly deceived myself into thinking that this was just about as challenging as life could get. For the other, I got really lucky with wheather and people; experiencing not only a mild and sunny spring, but also spent it with friends that felt like family. I mean, just look at some of my impressions from back then:

No wonder, my _Expectations_ for this second trip to _Vancouver_ were immensely high.
