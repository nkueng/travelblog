This repo holds the `jekyll` files based on which I build my [travelblog](https://nkueng.github.io/travelblog/).
The design is based on `jekyll`'s `minimal` theme by [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist) with minor changes to it.
All files can be found in the `gh-pages` branch.

To-Dos:
- add newsletter functionality
- add old texts from Vancouver to blog
